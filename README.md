## Background

The data set included with this analysis is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Your Task

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

Creating a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques, creating a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file directory, which will pull data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. 

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: It uses `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in the web browser.

## Bonus: Interactive Graphic
